# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Learning

This project focuses on automated brain tumor segmentation from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The notebook implements image preprocessing, model training, and tumor mask generation to accurately identify and segment tumor regions.

Features:
Preprocessing of MRI brain scans (resizing, normalization, and augmentation)

Implementation of U-Net and hybrid CNN-based models for segmentation

Training and validation with performance metrics

Visualization of original, ground truth, and predicted segmentation masks

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

Kaggle for experimentation and visualization
